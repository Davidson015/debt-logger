# Debt-Logger

##### Nothing much here, just me starting off with TypeScript sometime in '21 which I thought would be kinda cool to add on here.

## Installing the `node module(s)` I used

### npm
So far, I've only made use of the `tslib` library, so you could just run this:
```sh
npm install tslib
```
or
```sh
npm i tslib
```

### yarn
```sh
yarn add tslib
```

## Running the app

Once you've cloned this repo, navigate into the public directory and preview on a `live server` through your editor (I made use of a live server extension I've got installed in my `VS Code IDE`).

You can get it on [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
